Duplicated Function - Example ofuse that removes duplicates and adds to a new df
```{r}
carsNoDuplicateSpeeds <- cars[!duplicated(cars$speed),]
```


Merge function. - 
```{r}
carsToMerge <- cbind(carsNoDuplicateSpeeds, seq(1:length(carsNoDuplicateSpeeds$speed)))
carsToMerge <- carsToMerge[,c(1,3)]
cars <- cars

mergedcars <- merge(x = cars, y = carsToMerge, by = "speed", all = TRUE)
```
